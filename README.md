## Dependencies
This library depends on numpy and scipy.

## Setting up
"spinsys" is the core of the code. Make sure the folder is accessible to the
script importing it.

## Usage
Please refer to the docstrings of individual functions and classes.

All hamiltonian definitions go into the "spinsys/hamiltonian" folder and all
scripts, big and small, go into the "scripts" folder. The "spinsys" folder is
only for well planned code that can be reused.
